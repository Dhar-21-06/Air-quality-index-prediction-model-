# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. The model is developed using Python in Google Colab and utilizes various data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering:** Selecting and transforming relevant features for better model performance.
- **Model Selection & Training:** Using regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Evaluation & Optimization:** Measuring performance using RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics.
- **Deployment Readiness:** Preparing the model for real-world predictions.

## Dependencies
Ensure the following libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow keras
```

## How to Use
1. Open the Colab notebook using the link provided.
2. Upload the dataset or use an available dataset from a repository.
3. Run the cells step-by-step to preprocess data and train the model.
4. Evaluate model performance and adjust parameters as needed.
5. Save the trained model for future predictions.

## Possible Issues & Solutions
- **Low Accuracy:** Try feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or using ensemble models.
- **Data Issues:** Handle missing values and normalize data properly.
- **Overfitting:** Use regularization techniques or increase dataset size.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing deep learning models for better prediction.
- Incorporating real-time data updates.
- Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI for API-based predictions.
